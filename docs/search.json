We apply event history analysis and micro-level speed-accuracy tradeoff analysis to the RT + accuracy data measurend in various manual interference tasks (Stroop, Simon, flanker, stop-signal) that employ a stimulus-onset-asynchrony manipulation, to study whether the onset of interference in the hazard functions of response occurrence is time-locked to the visual onset of the task-irrelevant feature. For example, does word meaning in the Stroop task causes conflict starting around 450 ms after the letters appear? Does spatial location in the Simon task causes conflict starting around 150 ms after the location is stimulated?"
