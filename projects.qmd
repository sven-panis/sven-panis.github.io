## Bayesian Event History Analysis

What is the best way to analyze response times, saccade latencies, and fixation durations? Which approach can deal with right-censored observations (e.g., trials without a response)? Dr. Richard Ramsey and I developed a set of tutorials for applying Bayesian event history analysis to response time (RT) data, and Bayesian micro-level speed-accuracy tradeoff analysis to timed accuracy data. The tutorials are written in R and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sven-panis/Tutorial_Event_History_Analysis).


## Revisiting the Speed-of-Processing Hypothesis

When is conflict detected by the brain? What is the temporal dynamics of conflict detection versus resolution? We apply event history analysis and micro-level speed-accuracy tradeoff analysis to the RT + accuracy data measurend in various manual interference tasks (Stroop, Simon, flanker, stop-signal) that employ a stimulus-onset-asynchrony manipulation, to study whether the onset of interference in the hazard functions of response occurrence is time-locked to the visual onset of the task-irrelevant feature. For example, does word meaning in the Stroop task causes conflict ~450 ms after the letters appear? Does spatial location in the Simon task causes conflict ~150 ms after the location is stimulated?
